Reflection: DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system to help students prepare for their driving tests. Our client, DriverPass, needed a system that would provide students with access to both online practice exams and scheduling tools for on-the-road driving lessons. The goal was to create a user-friendly system that streamlines booking, profile management, and progress tracking, ensuring students are well-prepared for their exams.

Strengths and Areas for Improvement

A key strength in this project was the development of clear and organized UML diagrams, which visually represented the system's various components and workflows. These diagrams helped stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, understand the system’s structure and how each part would interact. The consistent and detailed approach to each diagram effectively communicated the design’s architecture and flow.

One area for improvement would be the technical requirements section in the System Design Document. In hindsight, I would have enhanced this section with more focus on scalability and future-proofing aspects of the system, such as cloud infrastructure scaling and third-party integration flexibility. This would better prepare the design to meet DriverPass’s potential growth needs and adapt to future challenges.

User Needs Interpretation

To capture and interpret user needs, I thoroughly analyzed the client’s interview transcript, translating each requirement into specific system functionalities. For example, the need for simple lesson scheduling led to features like real-time availability checks and booking confirmations. Prioritizing user needs is crucial in system design because it ensures the end product is both relevant and easy to use, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and effectiveness.

Approach to Software Design

My approach to software design begins with gathering user requirements and translating them into structured use cases. UML diagrams play a vital role in my analysis and design, helping visualize system interactions. In future projects, I aim to include user feedback cycles earlier in the design phase for better alignment with real user expectations. Additionally, focusing on modularity and scalability will help create adaptable designs that can evolve with client needs over time.
